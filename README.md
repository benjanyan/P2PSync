P2PSync
=======

An incomplete attempt at a Peer-to-peer file synchronisaion application in Java for my final year engineering project.

It will currently attempt two-way sync between two hard coded paths based on modification dates. This includes subdirectories. This is achieved by a simple protocol over a TCP socket and serialized objects.
